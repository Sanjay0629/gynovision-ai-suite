# Uterine Cancer Risk Prediction API

A Flask-based microservice for estimating uterine cancer risk based on clinical features. This service provides a prediction probability, risk tier classification, per-feature clinical contributions (SHAP equivalent), and rule-based clinical recommendations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🐳 Running with Docker (Recommended)
This service is fully containerized as part of the GynoVision AI Suite docker-compose network.
Simply run `docker compose up --build` from the root directory to start all services simultaneously.

### 💻 Manual Local Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

#### Installation
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend/uterine-cancer-model
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # Linux/Mac
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the API
```bash
python app.py
```
The server will start on **http://localhost:5007**.

## 🛠 API Endpoints

### 1. Health Check
`GET /health`
Returns the operational status of the API.

### 2. Model Information
`GET /model-info`
Returns metadata about the currently loaded model, including expected features and risk thresholds.

### 3. Predict Risk
`POST /predict/uterine`
Main endpoint for risk estimation. Requires a JSON body with 18 clinical features.

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Model Type**: Logistic Regression (with Class Weighting)
- **Input Features**: 18 clinico-pathological features.
- **Risk Stratification**:
  - **Low**: Probability < 0.56
  - **Intermediate**: Probability 0.56 – 0.65
  - **High**: Probability ≥ 0.65
- **Explainability**: Uses coefficient-based feature importance to show which factors increased or decreased the specific patient's risk.
- **Recommendations**: Integrated rule-based engine providing clinical guidance based on GOG/ESGO standards (e.g., endometrial thickness thresholds).
